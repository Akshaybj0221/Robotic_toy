\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Results}

The software is very effective and fast in tracking any tagging motion simultaneously. Its funtionality has been tested on multiple test videos and software has a success rate of 98\%.

The working output of the software can be seen in the output folder of the repository or the link below\+: \href{https://github.com/Akshaybj0221/ENPM808X_Midterm.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Akshaybj0221/\+E\+N\+P\+M808\+X\+\_\+\+Midterm.\+git}
